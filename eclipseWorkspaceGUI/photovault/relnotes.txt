PHOTOVAULT 0.5.0-dev

RELEASE NOTES

This is release 0.5.0 of Photovault, a cross-platform Java based image 
archiving application for photographers. 0.5.0 improves color adjustment 
possibilities, adds XML export for image metadata and fixes several importat bugs.

MAIN CHANGES IN PHOTOVAULT 0.5.0

New features

  * New color curve tool that makes it possible to adjust colors of all images,
    not just raw image files as in 0.4.0

  * New tool for adjusting saturation of images

  * New tool for deleting photos from database

  * Import/export metadata stored in Photovault database in XML format. In this 
    first version of the feature, Photovault just exports the whole content of 
    database, but in future this framework can be extended to allow more controlled
    exchange of image data.

  * Improved support for MacOS X. Photovault 0.5.0 adjusts is user interface to 
    be closer to look and feel of native MacOS applications. Also a native installer 
    for Mac is provided.

  * Significant speed improvements when changing raw conversion or color settings.
    This comes with price in image loading time - this can take somewhat longer
    than earlier.

  * Reorganized toolbars for better clarity and new keyboard accelerators for 
    most used functions.

  * The window for viewing individual images has the same controls & menus as main
    window

  * When opening multiple images to new window, Photovault no longer opens separate 
    windows for each. Instead, it opens only 1 window with all the images visible 
    as thumbnails in preview pane.

  * Discontinued support for Java 1.4.

Bug fixes

  * #107 Inconsistent logic for deciding whether a file is raw image

  * #108 Error in limiting crop bounds

  * #112 Thumbnail creator thread can go into infinite loop if thumbnail 
    creation is unsuccesful

  * #114 PhotoInfo#exportPhoto does not report all potential errors

  * #120 Crop action not disabled if preview pane is hidden

BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY

Photovault 0.5.0 requires Java SE 5 or newer. It will nnot work anymore with 
Java 1.4.

Version 0.5.0 adds new structures to database to support the new features (color
adjustment). If you open a database created with earlier version of Photovault, 
the program converts the database automatically to new format. The new database 
structure is backwards compatible with older versions starting from 0.2.0. 
However,  the earlier versions cannot display raw images at all or color adjustments 
of other images. It is still possible to edit meta data and see icons of these 
photos correctly. 

If you have used custom ICC profile for raw conversion in 0.4.0 you may notice
that you get different colors in 0.5.0. This is an intentional compatibility 
break. ICC profiles in 0.4.0 were broken and should not be used.

Starting from 0.4.0, Photovault configuration file format has changed. The new 
config file is saved in <HOME_DIRECTORY>/.photovault/photovault_config.xml 
by default. If this file is not found Photovault will search for the 
old configuration file named photovault.xml in the same directory. If that
file exists it will use information in the file to create the new 
configuration file. The old confugration file is preserved to allow usage 
of older versions, however, the old file is not updated with changes 
in configuration.


SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS

Photovault has been tested in Linux, Windows XP and MacOS X 10.4. It should work
in all environments supported by Java SE. However, raw conversion support works 
out-of-the-box only in the environments mentioned above. It is possible to use 
raw conversion in other architectures by supplying your own dcraw executable.

REQUIRED SOFTWARE

Photovault needs Sun Java 5 or newer and Java Advanced Imaging 
libraries to work. You can download both from Sun web site.

Photovault can use either Apache Derby or MySQL as metadata
store. Derby is included in this release; if you want to use MySQL
instead you need to download it from www.mysql.com.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Briefly:

  * Install Java from http://java.com/getjava 

  * Install Java Advanced Imaging from 
    http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/downloads/download-1_1_2_01.html

  * Install Photovault

  * Start Photovault and set database name & directory as the program asks for 
    them

See http://www.photovault.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/PhotovaultInstall for full 
installation instructions.

KNOWN ISSUES

  * Problems when viewing some indexed color PNG files. This is due to a bug in
    Sun's Java implementation

  * Some unit test cases do not pass due to unimplemented features and
    errors in Apache OJB version used in Photovault.
