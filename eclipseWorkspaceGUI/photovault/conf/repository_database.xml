<!--
Define here all used connections.
One defined connection should be defined as the default one,
by set default-connection="true" - this could be done at runtime too.

It is possible to set user/password at
runtime or let login different users at runtime using the same
database. Use different PBKey with same jcdAlias name but
different user/password.

Ditto it is possible to add jdbc-connection-descriptor at runtime
using the MetadataManager.
